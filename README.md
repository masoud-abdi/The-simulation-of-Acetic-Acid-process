# The-simulation-of-Acetic-Acid-process
The simulation of the acetic acid production was conducted by using ASPEN HYSYS v. 10.
I put the file here and be careful open it by ASPEN HYSYS v. 10.
In this project, we simulated the process using software tools and the use of stoichiometric reaction and stoichiometric reactor, which operates based on stoichiometric reaction and is an unrealistic equipment in the industry.
The data of each stream and the process flow diagram is attached.
If you have any questions, we will be in touch by my email (masoud abdi 789@gmail.com).
